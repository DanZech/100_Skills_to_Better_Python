Task_01: With a given number n, write a program to generate a dictionary that contains (i, i*i) such that i is an number between 1 and n (both included). and then the program should print the  dictionary

Task 02: 2. Write a program which accepts a sequence of comma-separated numbers from console/user and generates a list and a tuple which contains every number.

Task 3. Write a program which will find all the numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple of 5, between 1000 and 1500 (both included). The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.

Task 4. Define a function which can compute the sum of two numbers.
   
Task 5. Define a function that can receive two integral numbers in string form and compute their sum and then print it in console.

Task 6. Write a program which can compute the given factorial of a number.
   
Task 7. Use list comprehension to square each odd number in a list. The list is input by a sequence of comma-separated numbers.

Task 8. Write a program to roll a dice and get a random output (1-6).
